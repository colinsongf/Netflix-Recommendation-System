# Netflix-Recommendation-System
Files for creating a machine to recommend netflix movies using a restricted boltzmann machine.

The final product should be able to take input vectors, and produce a recommendation for the next movie to watch.

This project was inspired by the Netflix Prize and created for a class on Social Computing.

The RBM class is based off of various papers detailing RBMs used for collaborative filtering and RBMs used to win the Netflix Prize
