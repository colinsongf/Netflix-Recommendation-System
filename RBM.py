RBM.py
Contains the class definition of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine designed to make
predictions on items based on user ratings
Author: Forest Thomas
Notes:
    This RBM is designed to be used for sparse, two-dimensional inputs
    Therefore, most input vectors are going to be two dimensional
    eg: input[m][r]
        -m is the movie (or item)
        -r is the rating for that item
    The sparsity is handled by ignoring inputs with no ratings, therefore the calculations
    will be dynamic based on which movies have been rated.
